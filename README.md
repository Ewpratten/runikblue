RunikBlue is a script which was desinged to be clean, and look mystic (like old runes).
It's intended to be used with Latin, but can be used with any language provided what you are spelling fits within it's limited alphabet.

RunikBlue uses a combination of 20 characters and 5 alternative characters for vowels (which make words shorter).

###### Alternative Characters

Alternative Characters include duplicates of `a - e - o - u` and the additinal character `i`

You only use Alternatives if there is another character infront of them. You can also only use one at a time.

Take the example below:

![Example of the word "Salvete" in RB](/resources/images/salvete_example.png)

In the above, you'll see `Salvete`(Latin/"Greetings") written in RunikBlue.

As you can see, we append the first `a` to `S` and `e` to `u`, even though `u` has an Alternative.
(When multiple vowels are in a row, you only use the Alternative for the last one.)

![Example of the letter "i" in RB](/resources/images/i_vs_ei_example.png)

`I` is unique, in that it's not it's own character. (`i` is actually a modifacation of `e`)

When following an `e`, you would actually write `e(ei)` as shown in the image above, and in the example of the word `Eight` below.

###### Other characters

When sepperating words, remember to use dashes`-` not spaces.

Also, it is intended for you to Roman Numerals instead of digits. (For these, use latin characters not RB)
