RunikBlue is desinged to look mystic, like old runes.
It's intended to be used with Latin, but can be used with any language provided what you are spelling fits within it's limited alphabet.

RunikBlue uses a combination of 20 characters and 5 alternative characters for vowels (which make words shorter).
